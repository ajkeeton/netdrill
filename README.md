The only reason it isn't marked private is because I don't feel a need to pay
for an account just to keep eyes off!

# Tmod

Over the years I've coded up a number of useful utilities and implementations of
half-baked ideas. This project is an evolving intersection of a few.

Some of the code was originally written in straight C, and other in C++. This 
codebase is a mashup of the two. Best practices and aesthetics played no part 
here.

The most interesting chunk of code is based on some work I did with AI back around
2003. The goal is to use machine-learning to find interesting behavior in network 
traffic.
